Raddish-DB is the database layer of raddish, also to be used standalone in other projects.  
Feel free to fork and submit a pull request when deemed necessary.

This module is a evolution of the universal-query module, this module will completely replace that module.

## What can you expect from this module?
This module is an evolution of universal-query and thus a query builder is bound to be included,
next to this a complete database layer is included as well following the same principles!

The same API for all the adapters, no exception there!

### Features

- Out of the box support for mysql, sqlite, mongo and postgresql.
- Optional ssh layer.
- Super fast performance
- Promise based API.
- Option to add custom adapters.

## A little road map
At this moment it is planned to move this to a C++ language, just for performance matters,
and of course to learn a new language, but mostly the performance.

Although the first version will be build in node and later converted to C++ for first the API must be there.
Then the rest will follow just as easy.
